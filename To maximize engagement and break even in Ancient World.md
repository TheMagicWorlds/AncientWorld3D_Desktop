To prioritize magical moment features in the 3D Virtual Ancient World with AI bots operating autonomously in our Unity build, we leverage user activity data from March 12, 2025, to optimize engagement as of March 13, 2025:

* **Peak Hour Emphasis**: During high-activity hours (06:00, 10:00, 17:00, 20:00), with 4 total logins and peak API calls (e.g., 114 at 20:00), schedule striking magical moments—like AI philosophers delivering glowing speeches or mythical creatures appearing with radiant effects—every 15-20 minutes to maximize immersion and captivate users.  
* **Off-Peak Maintenance**: In low-activity times (e.g., 07:00, 0 logins), trigger subtle moments, such as bots reciting poetry with faint sparkles, every 30-45 minutes to keep the world alive.  
* **Engagement Focus**: With only 2 unique logins, prioritize captivating, educational visuals—like interactive history lessons with shimmering effects—to boost retention and encourage longer stays.
